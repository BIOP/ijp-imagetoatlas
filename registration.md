### Slices selection and display options

Hold and drag the left mouse button allows to draw rectangles and select the slices you want to operate on. Each slice has a round handle which serve to indicate if it is selected (green) or not (yellow). Drawing rectangle with the modifier keys allow to add or remove slices to the current selection:
* `hold and left-click` draw a rectangle to select slices
* `ctrl + hold and left-click` remove slices from the current selection
* `shift + hold and left-click` add slices to the current selection

:warning:  you need to hold the modifier keys BEFORE drawing the rectangle in order to take their effect into account. This is in contrast to a lot of other software and a limitation of the UI of BigDataViewer

`ctrl+a` allows to select all slices, `ctrl+shift+a` allows to deselect all slices.
