## Using ABBA-Python

Please check the section about [ABBA-Python](abba_python.md), in particular the section about [jupyter notebooks](abba_python.md#with-jupyter-notebooks).

## Other repositories for data analysis

You can use the scripts developed by [@enassar](https://github.com/enassar) and [@nickdelgrosso](https://github.com/nickdelgrosso) in this repository: https://github.com/nickdelgrosso/ABBA-QuPath-utility-scripts in order to automate cell detection and export.

:warning: the repo has not been updated to the more recent ABBA version, so please use https://github.com/NicoKiaru/ABBA-QuPath-utility-scripts instead.

An alternative repository which allows to do additional processing is available in https://github.com/bmi-lsym/ABBA-QuPath-post_processing

Note that these set of scripts may not have been yet update to the most recent version of ABBA.
