ABBA, which is Java based, can be used in conjunction with Python. This allows to use Python functionalities (BrainGlobe, DeepSlice) during the registration, but also to run python code for analysis after the registration. The 'glue' between Java and Python is made with [`JPype`](https://github.com/jpype-project/jpype) and [`PyImageJ`](https://github.com/imagej/pyimagej). There are different ways to use ABBA-Python as explained below.


Please check the readme of [abba_python](https://github.com/BIOP/abba_python) to see how to install and use it.
